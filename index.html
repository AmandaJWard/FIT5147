        <p>Computers have changed from being large, expensive, inaccessible objects to being small, portable objects that can be bought at the local shopping mall with less than a days salary.  Research completed by the Pew Centre (2015)* suggests that at least 73% of all adult American’s own a laptop or desktop computer, and that at least 68% of them own a smart phone.  Reduction in size and price, associated with an improvement in performance means that computers are now used to perform tasks that they weren’t able to perform 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>With these changes in technology, we would expect to see an associated change in the way American’s use their time.  What does the average American day look like?  How many people use computers and what do they use them for?  How has it changed over time?</p>

      <h3> The Average American Day</h3>
      <div class="large-12 columns">
        <div class="callout">
          <p>Let’s start by looking at the typical American day.  The data used for these visualisations are from the American Time Use Survey (2003-2015)**. This is a survey that is completed each year by the American Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS).  The typical American spends on average, 8 hours and 48 mins sleeping, and 7 hours at work.  Please be mindful that these hours include weekends, which is why the average working time is not as high as you would expect.</p>

            <div id="clockHands"></div>
          </div>
          <p>Unfortunately, there is no specific activity recorded just for computer use, so we will need to look at the different components of the average day that may include computer use.  This includes work, recreation and gaming.</p>

      <h3>Working with computers</h3>

          <div width="1000" height="400" id="employment"></div>
          <p>In 2003 only 2.4% of ATUS respondents had jobs in technology occupations such as Computer Software Engineers, Computer Programmers, Computer Scientists and Systems Analysts.  Where as in 2015, this has increased more than 100%, with 4.5% of all respondents suggesting they are working in these industries.  The BLS even added extra occupation classifications in 2011 in order to match the growth of employment in these areas.</p>

          <div width="1000" height="400" id="average"></div>
          <p>The ATUS survey classes activities such as computer games under the category of “Gaming, including use of computer games”.  Activities relating to using a computer for personal communication, such as Email, Twitter, Facebook, plus general Internet surfing are reported as “Use of a computer for recreational use (not computer games)”.   Both of these categories have shown increases in the time that the ATUS survey has been running, with the total increase represented below.</p>

          <p>The interactive visualization below demonstrates the start and stop times of people using a computer for recreational use.  Please select your age and your sex from the drop down menus, then you can see how you compare.  The curves represent the percentage of people in that category that are using computers at that time of day.  There is an obvious evening rush, where most people would be home from work, relaxing and using computers for socialization or entertainment purposes.</p>
